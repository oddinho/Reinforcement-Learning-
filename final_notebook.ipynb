    "From a technical perspective, deploying the robot on factory floors instead of in homes is risky due to the significant difference between the training and deployment environments. Factory floors typically involve different conditions, and requirements. This may cause a policy trained in homes to generalize poorly. This shift could lead to reduced performance or unsafe behaviour. It would therefore be important to retrain the robot in factory like environments.
