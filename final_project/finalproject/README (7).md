# Final Project

## Getting Started
To install the package, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
pip install -e .
```

To verify your installation, you can run a match between two agents:

```
python src/compete/compete.py src/agents/baseline/ src/agents/baseline/
```

you can also run a match between two agents of your choice:

```
python src/compete/compete.py <path to agent 1> <path to agent 2>
```

add --output replay.json to save the replay of the match

```
python src/compete/compete.py <path to agent 1> <path to agent 2> --output replay.json
```

To visualise the saved replay, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
python src/visualiser/visualiser.py replay.json
```

## Environment

To play the game yourself, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
python src/visualiser/play_collector.py <seed>
```

Example:
```
python src/visualiser/play_collector.py 0
```

Example of how to run the environment:
```python
from environments.collector.params import EnvParams
from environments.collector.wrappers import CollectorGymEnv

env = CollectorGymEnv(numpy_output=True) # numpy_output=True for numpy arrays, False for JAX arrays
env_params = EnvParams()
obs, info = env.reset()
while not env.done:
    action = self.env.action_space.sample()
    opponent_action = self.env.action_space.sample()
    actions = {"player_0": action, "player_1": opponent_action}
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break
env.close()
``` 

To record a game wrap the environment in in RecordEpisode:
```python
from environments.collector.params import EnvParams
from environments.collector.wrappers import CollectorGymEnv, RecordEpisode
env = CollectorGymEnv(numpy_output=True)
env_params = EnvParams()
save_dir = "path/to/save"  
env = RecordEpisode(env, save_dir=save_dir)
obs, info = env.reset()
agent = Agent(config) 
agent.load() # if you have pre-trained weights
while not env.done:
    action = agent.act(obs["player_0"])
    opponent_action = self.env.action_space.sample()
    actions = {"player_0": action, "player_1": opponent_action}
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    if terminated or truncated:
        break
env.close()
```
Saves the episode in the save_dir as episode_id.json

To visualise a recorded game, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
python src/visualiser/visualiser.py <path to episode_id.json>
```

### Observations
The observation is a dictionary with:
```python
{
    "player_0": obs_0,
    "player_1": obs_1
}
```
where `obs_0` and `obs_1` are the observations for the two players. 
```python
# T is the number of teams (default is 2)
# W, H are the width and height of the map
obs_0 = {
    'units': {
        'position': Array(T, 2)
        },
    'map_features': {
        # 2D array representing the board
        # 0: empty
        # 1: obstacle
        # 2: item
        'tile_type': Array(W, H) 
        },
    'team_points': Array(T),
    'items_on_map': int,
    'steps': int
    }
```
A players observation is always from the perspective of them being player_0. Meaning a player always sees the game from the perspective of them being `player_0` and the other player as `player_1`.

You might want to preprocess the observation and do feature engineering before feeding it to your agent.

### Actions
Actions are discrete and are represented as integers. The action space is a Discrete(4) space. The actions are as follows:
- 0: Move up
- 1: Move right
- 2: Move down
- 3: Move left

### Rewards
Rewards from the environment are given based on the following rules:
- Collecting an item: +1
- Hitting a wall or obstacle: -2
- otherwise: -1

Please feel free to do any reward shaping you see fit.


## Agent
Your goal is to create a reinforcement learning agent that competes in the Collector environment.

Create your agent in:

```
src/
└── 
    agents/
    └── agent/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── agent.py        👈 Your agent goes here!
        └── config.yaml     👈 Your agent’s configuration
```

### agent.py
You must implement a class Agent in agents/agent/agent.py.
Your class should inherit from BaseAgent and implement two methods:

```python
class Agent(BaseAgent):
    def act(self, observation: EnvState) -> int:
    """Return the next action given an observation."""

    def load(self) -> None:
        """Load any pre-trained weights if needed using the path from config.yaml."""
        #torch example
        # load_path = self.config.weights_dir # src/agents/your_agent/weights

        # self.network.load_state_dict(torch.load(os.path.join(load_path, "weights.pth")))
        # if self.config.training:
        #     self.network.train()
        # else:
        #     self.network.eval()
```

### config.yaml
You must provide a configuration file in agents/agent/config.yaml.
This file should any hyperparameters or settings that your agent needs to run.

Example:
```yaml
  learning_rate: 0.001
  batch_size: 32
  epsilon: 0.1
  gamma: 0.99
  weights_dir: "path/to/weights.pth"
```
The config is passed to your agent as a SimpleNamespace. So you can access the values like this:
```python
class Agent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.lr = config.learning_rate
        self.batch_size = config.batch_size
        self.epsilon = config.epsilon
        self.gamma = config.gamma
        self.weights_path = config.weights_path
```

### Random and Baseline Agent
We provide two agents, a random agent and baseline agent. These can be found in `src/agents/random/agent.py` and  `src/agents/baseline/agent.py`, respectively. The baseline agent is a simple rule-based agent that combines a self-avoiding walk with a greedy item collection strategy + an $\epsilon$ randomness.

Your goal is to create an agent that can beat these agents. When you have trained your agent, you can test it against the agents by running:

```
python src/compete/compete.py src/agents/your_agent/ src/agents/random/ --output replay_random.json
python src/compete/compete.py src/agents/your_agent/ src/agents/baseline/ --output replay_baseline.json
```
and visualise the replay with:
```
python src/visualiser/visualiser.py replay_random.json
python src/visualiser/visualiser.py replay_baseline.json
```

### Leaderboard and Tournament
You send your agent to compete against other agents and take part into the final tournament. To send in your agent upload your agent at http://158.37.65.35/. The leaderboard will be updated with the results of the tournament.
